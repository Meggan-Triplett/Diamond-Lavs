# Diamond-Lavs
Find public restrooms nearby

**Author**: Guru Batth, Gwen Zubatch, Meggan Triplett & Ray Johnson
**Version**: 1.4.2 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This app will allow users to enter their location and find nearby public bathrooms they can use. Users will be able to add new public restrooms to the database. Users will also be able to rate the bathroom on cleanliness, accessibility, and mark down any additional features. Such as if there is a baby changing station. API sources will be utilized to grab location data and existing restrooms.

We hope to provide an answer to the age old question of, where is the nearest restroom?
